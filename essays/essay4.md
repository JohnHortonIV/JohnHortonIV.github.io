## Fitting The Piecess

  To solve a problem efficiently you must have a method to solve it. Finding the way you are going to solve a problem can be just as important as the solution itself as the method can be used in the future to solve another similar problem in the future. Instead of creating a new method to solve every problem, it is much more practical to use a method you have used before and fit it into your new problem. Using a similar method in a new problem is similar to recognizing patterns. Recognizing patterns can be a useful tool to train your brain to find a solution based on solutions that used a similar pattern. In coding a design pattern is not finished code, but a reusable solution that can be used multiple ways. Design patterns are often used so that common problems have common solutions that everyone can use and everyone can recognize.
  
## Creating New Solutions

  In my code I usually have similar design patterns throughout what I write. When I run into a problem I often look at a previous problem I had solved and then see if I can use similar code or even the same solution and format it into my code. This can be beneficial because it makes different code I have written be able to be read in a similar way. It also allows me to refine solutions I have used before. For example, a function I use before may have worked in a rudimentary way, but now after re-implementing it, I am able to streamline it or maybe even add new features. Design patterns as a whole can help your different code flow together and create a language that you can recognize as your own, they allow you to hone your code writing abilities and standardize your own way of writing.
