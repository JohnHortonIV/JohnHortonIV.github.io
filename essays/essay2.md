  For software engineering, I am interested in learning how website development works and also what it takes to develop web applications. I think when you experience a web site or application that is well thought out and has a friendly UI, even if you don’t know too much about web development, you can tell just by using it that something is well made. Designing something that is easy to use while also having a high level of functionality is something that I would like to understand what it takes to make something like that. 

  Some skills I’d like to learn is how to create a large scale project, something which is different from other small coding projects I have done for other classes. Making something my own that I am able to be more creative and flexible with my code is something that interests me a lot. Being able to improvise with my code and not having a specific way I have to do something is an aspect of this software engineering class that I look forward to. I would also like to refine my coding skills in a way that I don’t think so linearly, by this I mean that when looking for a solution in my code I don’t just look in a straight, but am able to branch off and use other ways to solve a problem.
  
  Making a software engineering project that is large scale will probably involve plenty of things that will go wrong when drafting the code required. To deal with this, a skill I’ll have to develop better is debugging, whether it is simple syntax errors or larger scaled issues with how a project runs. I predict that a lot of what can improve this skill will mostly be experience with coding, and experience with coding requires a lot of practice, something I assume I will be doing a lot in this class.
