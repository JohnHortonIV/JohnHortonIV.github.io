  So far I have been enjoying Javascript, although it is a bit different than what I am used to. Before Javascript my experience in coding was Java, C, and C++. All three of those languages so far have been far stricter languages than Javascript. Most of my coding conventions have been broken by Javascript. For example ,“;” are not necessary, nor is declaring types of variables.
 
 <div class="ui small rounded images">
  <img class="ui image" src="../images/javascript.pngg">
</div>


 
  Javascript to me is a great in between language, something that you could use on projects that have a lot of wiggle room in the actual code. On the surface Javascript can be very easy to understand for someone with little or no coding experience.Some of the downsides to Javascript I think one could encounter is that being a loose language, some large scale projects that feature a large amount of functions, variables, etc., could end up contradicting each other and would rather benefit from a language that has stricter conventions. Overall, I enjoy Javascript and look forward to seeing what makes it unique and it’s best uses.
