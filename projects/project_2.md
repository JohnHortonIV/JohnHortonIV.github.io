  One of my goals while pursuing a career in computer science has been to get some form of certificate. The reason for this is that I would like to show that I am capable of doing the tech support work I aim to be applying for. I chose the Google IT course to start as I figured I could learn some fundamentals and it could better prepare me for other certificates I aim to complete, such as Microsoft+ and CompTIA Network+. This course taught basic IT support solution and general info regarding PC architecture.

  Some of the skills that were taught were Windows installation, Linux installation, network layers, and other aspects that would be helpful to tech support.
